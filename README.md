Breadboard is a module for [Breadcord](https://github.com/Breadcord/Breadcord), a framework for discord bots written in Python.

Breadboard adds a highly configurable starboard to your bot, which allows users to "star" messages, 
and have them be displayed in a separate channel -- similar in nature to pins, 
but voted on by the community.
